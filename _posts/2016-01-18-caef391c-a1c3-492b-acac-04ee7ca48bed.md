Pamela Chen is a clairvoyant who "sees + gets messages" that will inform you to look out for specific clues in life, to help you achieve your goals in a noisy distracting world. 

As a Law of Attraction Coach + Reiki Master + Certified Angel Card Reader by Doreen Virtue, she will give you a better psychic reading then a magic 8 ball.

She loves strawberry shortcakes + tutus + mermaid hair.
