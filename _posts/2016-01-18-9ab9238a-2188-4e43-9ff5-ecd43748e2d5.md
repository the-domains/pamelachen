Looking for a modern psychic?

Hi! You found her. 

(And no I'm not Miss Cleo, but I do have a crystal ball + a mermaid tail).

I'm totally here to help you through the tough crappy decisions you have to make in life. Especially about love + careers/finance.

Giving readings + guiding people to finding their husbands + launching their own businesses are my cup of tea. Been so honored to have helped many humans + mermaids alike for over a decade with my intuitive guidance.

If your ready to book an appointment click here.

Can't manifest for crap? Want to know how I manifested front row Janet Jackson tickets + a husband for my client? Click here if your ready to get what you want.

If you want to know what the heck is a psychic reading + what's so special about Pamela's readings, then click here.

Since I do have to dance ballet, walk my unicorn, + brush my mermaid hair I would suggest you to book an appointment through email.
